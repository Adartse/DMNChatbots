# Transforming DMN Decision Tables intoChatbots

This repository shares prototype examples of chatbots generated following the methodology proposed in the article _"Transforming DMN Decision Tables into Chatbots"_, presented for its evaluation at the BPM 2020 International Conference.

Although the methodology proposed in the article can be applied to different tools, the example chatbots were implemented using Dialogflow. For each example you will find:

* _README-Example#.txt_: where the characteristics of the implemented chatbot are described.
* _RiskCategory(Example#).zip_ and _RiskCategory(Example#)-function-source.zip_: which contain the source code with the structure and elements of the chatbot, which can be imported into Dialogflow.
* _Link_chatbot_web_access-Example1.txt_: A file with the link to the web version of the chatbot example.
* _Link_questionnaire-Example1.txt_: It contains a link to the form used for the evaluation of the example. 
* _DMNDecisionTable_Example-#.pdf_: It contains the DMN model that was the basis for building the chatbot.
* _Conversation_Example#.png_: An image containing an example of a chatbot user conversation using the Telegram application.
